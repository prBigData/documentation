Introduction

This guide aims to give you any clue to go on working on our project. It will focus on technical choices and the technical aspects of the project while we describe the scientific aspects of the project within our project report.

If you are part of a new team working on this PRDW project, we suggest you proceed the following way :

1. Get used to the linux environment and the development server if you're not
2. Read & understand the scraper's doc, and set it up if not already done
3. Read the project report to understand the technologic choices we have done for our Big Data architecture. You can begin to question it, but we advise you not to try a new architecture unless you've accomplished at least a bit of data analysis first
4. Get used to the pyspark shell and using our python scripts to generate the density maps
5. GO AHEAD : think about new data mining algorithms, and implement it
