This section deals with some scripts we have built to generate different density maps of the vessels within the mediterranean sea.

****************************
Data analysis - Introduction
****************************

As you might have noticed, we have spent a lot of time (too much time) on figuring out a way to compose our datasets, and to technically implement our solutions leads. We have finally achieved to build the two main pieces of our projects : the scrapers, providing us with our datasets, and the Big Data architecture, allowing us to store our data and to manipulate it.

The next milestone was to perform outstanding analysis on these pieces of data, but due to some lack of time, we only built scripts to generate density maps of vessels within the mediterranean sea area.

We think that your main job will consist in performing rigorous and interesting analysis on this dataset and wish you good luck :).
